## 📊 Project Overview
This project is a guided case study from the *Customer Engagement Analysis with SQL & Tableau* course by 365 Data Science. It explores customer behavior, engagement patterns, and business performance using SQL for data processing and Tableau for interactive visualization. The goal is to derive actionable insights that support data-driven decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (MySQL)**: Data cleaning, aggregation, and view creation
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling
- **GitHub**: Portfolio hosting and documentation

---

## 🔑 Key Dashboards
- **Overview**: High-level KPIs (engaged students, minutes per student, completion rate, ratings)
- **Engagement**: Time spent learning, distribution of minutes watched
- **Cohorts**: Student onboarding and subscription analysis
- **Exams & Certificates**: Exam pass rates and certificate issuance trends
- **Learning**: Paid vs free student engagement patterns

---

## 📊 Platform Engagement

- Over **19,000 students** have engaged with the platform's content.
- Daily engagement grew from **100 students in January** to **400 in October**.
- Some free-plan students converted to paid subscriptions, causing overlap in engagement counts.
- The final three months of the analysis period recorded the **highest engagement levels**.

---

## 🚀 Onboarding & Retention

- Onboarding rate ranged between **40–60%**, rising to **70%** after platform updates in mid-September.
- **Recommended strategy**: Monthly retargeting of recent registrants via paid ads to boost engagement and conversions.
- Among paying students:
  - **50%** remain active after one month.
  - **40%** retention in period two.
  - Stabilizes at **30%** long-term engagement.
- Higher new subscriber counts in **January, March, July, and September** align with major marketing campaigns.
- Cohort analysis shows returning students engaging with the **new gamified platform**, improving retention.

## 💡 Free-to-Paid Conversion Rate (F2P CR) & Subscription Duration

- Approximately **3%** of registered users convert to paid plans (~560 students).
- Students who watch **at least 2 hours** of content show a **~40% conversion rate**.
- Students with **40–50 minutes** of watched content display consistent conversion behavior.
- Courses with higher conversion rates should be **highlighted to free-plan users**.
- Longer watched durations correlate with **longer subscription periods**, reinforcing the importance of early engagement.

## 🧠 Proposed Strategies

1. **Quiz-based recommendation system** to help students discover relevant courses.
2. **A/B test a 24-hour free access window** to boost engagement and conversion.
3. Emphasize early engagement, as **longer watched durations lead to longer subscriptions**.
